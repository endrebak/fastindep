 Data read in from file ./dat.txt
 Total number of elements in dataset = 10
 5 sets of elements with pairwise association <= 0.85 requested
 Number of singletons is 1
 Number related to all 0
 Connectivity = 0.111111
 Using user supplied seed  1260646394 for Mersenne Twister
 From 5 attempts 5 distinct sets found 
 The sets of elements are arranged row by row with the deterministic output first 
 subsequent rows are ordered in decreasing size

 Number of elements from deterministic heuristic is 6
 Largest Number of elements from random heuristic is 6
 Smallest Number of elements from random heuristic is 5
 Largest Maximal independent set has size 6 and multiplicity 4
 Size distribution of independent sets is: 
 Map Size 5 occurs 1 times 
 Map Size 6 occurs 4 times 

 Total number of distinct elements covered is 10
 Total number of elements covered is 29
 Printing Independent Sets first set is the Greedy Set
